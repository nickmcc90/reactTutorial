--Why React?--
1. The way that it uses its virtual DOM is more efficient than vanilla JS.
2. Reusable and clearer web components.
3. It's maintained by facebook, so people are constantly looking after it.
4. React is very hirable.

React is a large framework, and you may not want to use it and download all its
libraries if you are doing a small project.

--ReactDOM & JSX--
JSX is a javascript rendition of HTML. We need to import React from "react" because this
enables JSX to be usable.

** One way to set up React in a project is to have 3 script tags in the header (they 
are in the index.html, so we can just copy these) 

    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>

and a type='text/babel' in the script
tag that is in the body that has src='index.js'. Then we go into the index.js and do
the:
ReactDOM.render(<h1>hello world</h1>, document.getElementById("root")); 
of course having a div in our index.html with the id of root.

**^^^ The above way is the easy way to put react in, not the correct way.

Here is the long way to create an element and have it go to the html page using JS:

const h1 = document.createElement("h1")
h1.textContent = "This is an imperative way to program"    // this is used rather than .innerHTML
h1.className = "header"
document.getElementById("root").append(h1)

These lines of code are what we would write if we didn't have react. React allows us to
write these same four lines of code by using JSX like in line 21. Or like this: 

ReactDOM.render(<h1 className="header">Hello, React!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));

Remember, we must wrap all JSX that is going into the ReactDOM line into one element. This could
just be wrapping everything into one neat div.

***Correct way is to just type the command found in the other tutorial into the terminal...
Type this into the terminal:
  npm create vite@latest 'project-name' -- --template react
This command created this folder, and a few files to start with. We have TailwindCSS in this.




----ACTUAL TUTORIAL NOTES------
The making of this react app is done in scrimba unfortunately, but all the notes I do from that
will be taken here.
